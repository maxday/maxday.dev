Maxime David, Serverless Software Engineer at Datadog and AWS Community Builder, joins Julian Wood to go deep into cold start benchmarks.
You may have read blog posts about coldstart benchmarks but unfortunately those are likely to be outdated. See how Maxime created a project to gather Lambda coldstarts across all runtimes.
The report runs daily and compares and visualizes coldstart performance. You can see how Lambda optimizes cold starts over time.</description></item><item><title>Inception!

Why do you need it? How to implement it?
After defining some of the core concepts of observability, we will see why OpenTelemetry could be a key component of your applications. This talk will be punctuated by live demos to showcase how to implement OpenTelemetry in two different runtimes, spoiler alert: one of them is Rust :)

Abstract XCode provides developers with two kinds of test : unit tests and UI tests. This live coding session will introduce both of these concepts.
Schedule :
Why should I test my mobile app ? Live coding : synchronous and asynchronous tests Live coding : UI tests Code coverage Everything shown in the session is available on Github, no more excuses to skip the tests :)</description></item><item><title>Grunt power: developing and releasing your web app has never been so easy</title><link>https://maxday.dev/talks/2015-11-16-grunt-power-developping-and-releasing-your-web-app-has-never-been-so-easy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/talks/2015-11-16-grunt-power-developping-and-releasing-your-web-app-has-never-been-so-easy/</guid><description>Abstract Grunt is a very (very) powerful tool to automate your JavaScript webapp development and release tasks. During a step by step live demo, I will present how to use this tool and why this is a must have in every front-end developers toolbox.
During live demos, we will see how to use Grunt to :
start a local server to run your application watch for code or style modifications (live reload) compile SASS/LESS files to regular CSS concatenate and minify JavaScript files check for JavaScript errors against our pre-defined standard (thanks to JSHint) add copyright headers to files run unit tests and end-to-end tests deploy the app to your integration servers link to the talk | pdf</description></item></channel></rss>
