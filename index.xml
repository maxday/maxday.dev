Each runtime has to conform to the AWS Lambda runtime API.
In managed runtimes, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to take care of that; that&amp;rsquo;s the whole point of using a managed runtime! AWS takes care of that for you.
But how?
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say because it&amp;rsquo;s not clearly documented. However, while I was conducting some unrelated experiments, I made a very cool discovery!</description></item><item><title>Benchmarking Lambda cold starts</title><link>https://maxday.dev/talks/2023-07-04-benchmarking-lambda-cold-starts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/talks/2023-07-04-benchmarking-lambda-cold-starts/</guid><description>Abstract: Want to understand and minimize Lambda coldstarts?
Maxime David, Serverless Software Engineer at Datadog and AWS Community Builder, joins Julian Wood to go deep into cold start benchmarks.
You may have read blog posts about coldstart benchmarks but unfortunately those are likely to be outdated. See how Maxime created a project to gather Lambda coldstarts across all runtimes.
The report runs daily and compares and visualizes coldstart performance. You can see how Lambda optimizes cold starts over time.</description></item><item><title>Inception!

Why should I care to benchmark Rust since it&amp;rsquo;s already super fast? That&amp;rsquo;s the question we&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer in this post!
Will there be a 🍕 demo? Of course, you know that I&amp;rsquo;m a true 🍕🍕🍕 lover!
What&amp;rsquo;s so special about Serverless? Benchmarking is not specific to serverless. But in serverless components, such as AWS Lambda functions, performance really matters for two main reasons:</description></item><item><title>OpenTelemetry, buzz-word or real need?</title><link>https://maxday.dev/talks/2023-03-22-opentelemetry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/talks/2023-03-22-opentelemetry/</guid><description>Abstract: What is OpenTelemetry? Why do you need it? How to implement it?
After defining some of the core concepts of observability, we will see why OpenTelemetry could be a key component of your applications. This talk will be punctuated by live demos to showcase how to implement OpenTelemetry in two different runtimes, spoiler alert: one of them is Rust :)

Our function may looks like this simple example: print n times the name given in parameter.
fn greeting(nb: i32, name: &amp;amp;str) { for _ in 0..nb { println!(&amp;#34;hi {}&amp;#34;, name); } } How to test it? 🤔 It looks hard.
One easy way is to refactor our code using a Trait. You can see Traits as interfaces.</description></item><item><title>Building and Monitoring a Serverless App on AWS</title><link>https://maxday.dev/talks/2022-10-19-building-and-monitoring-a-serverless-app-on-aws/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/talks/2022-10-19-building-and-monitoring-a-serverless-app-on-aws/</guid><description>Abstract: In this workshop, you’ll learn how to use Datadog to trace through popular AWS managed services like API Gateway, SNS, and SQS—and how you can use these insights to successfully operate your serverless services at scale. You’ll see this firsthand by designing, deploying, and monitoring a fully serverless GitHub bot.

Abstract XCode provides developers with two kinds of test : unit tests and UI tests. This live coding session will introduce both of these concepts.
Schedule :
Why should I test my mobile app ? Live coding : synchronous and asynchronous tests Live coding : UI tests Code coverage Everything shown in the session is available on Github, no more excuses to skip the tests :)</description></item><item><title>Grunt power: developing and releasing your web app has never been so easy</title><link>https://maxday.dev/talks/2015-11-16-grunt-power-developping-and-releasing-your-web-app-has-never-been-so-easy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/talks/2015-11-16-grunt-power-developping-and-releasing-your-web-app-has-never-been-so-easy/</guid><description>Abstract Grunt is a very (very) powerful tool to automate your JavaScript webapp development and release tasks. During a step by step live demo, I will present how to use this tool and why this is a must have in every front-end developers toolbox.
During live demos, we will see how to use Grunt to :
start a local server to run your application watch for code or style modifications (live reload) compile SASS/LESS files to regular CSS concatenate and minify JavaScript files check for JavaScript errors against our pre-defined standard (thanks to JSHint) add copyright headers to files run unit tests and end-to-end tests deploy the app to your integration servers link to the talk | pdf</description></item></channel></rss>
