Each runtime has to conform to the AWS Lambda runtime API.
In managed runtimes, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to take care of that; that&amp;rsquo;s the whole point of using a managed runtime! AWS takes care of that for you.
But how?
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say because it&amp;rsquo;s not clearly documented. However, while I was conducting some unrelated experiments, I made a very cool discovery!</description></item><item><title>Benchmarking Rust for Serverless</title><link>https://maxday.dev/posts/2023-04-13-benchmarking-rust-for-serverless/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/posts/2023-04-13-benchmarking-rust-for-serverless/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with two very important questions:
Why should I care to benchmark Rust since it&amp;rsquo;s already super fast? That&amp;rsquo;s the question we&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer in this post!
Will there be a 🍕 demo? Of course, you know that I&amp;rsquo;m a true 🍕🍕🍕 lover!
What&amp;rsquo;s so special about Serverless? Benchmarking is not specific to serverless. But in serverless components, such as AWS Lambda functions, performance really matters for two main reasons:</description></item><item><title>How to test println!</title><link>https://maxday.dev/posts/2022-11-22-how-to-test-println-in-rust/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://maxday.dev/posts/2022-11-22-how-to-test-println-in-rust/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to test that a function is correctly outputting something.
Our function may looks like this simple example: print n times the name given in parameter.
fn greeting(nb: i32, name: &amp;amp;str) { for _ in 0..nb { println!(&amp;#34;hi {}&amp;#34;, name); } } How to test it? 🤔 It looks hard.
One easy way is to refactor our code using a Trait. You can see Traits as interfaces.</description></item></channel></rss>
